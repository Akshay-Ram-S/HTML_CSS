Tabbed Content Interface

Objective : The purpose of this project is to create a tabbed content interface where clicking on a tab reveals different content sections. The interface uses hidden radio buttons (or checkboxes) along with labels that serve as tabs. When a tab is selected, the corresponding content is displayed, and the rest are hidden.
