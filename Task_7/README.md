Pure CSS Carousel/Slider

Objective: to create an image carousel that cycles through slides automatically and allows for manual slide selection. This is done without any JavaScript and using CSS animations and pseudo-classes.

Concepts revised:

1. CSS Margin and Padding
2. CSS Image attributes
3. CSS Transitions
4. CSS :hover Pseudo-class

Concepts learned:

1. CSS Animation:

CSS Keyframes: When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

The animation-duration property defines how long an animation should take to complete.

The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.

The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.

The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).
