Tabbed Content Interface

Objective : The purpose of this project is to create a tabbed content interface where clicking on a tab reveals different content sections. The interface uses hidden radio buttons (or checkboxes) along with labels that serve as tabs. When a tab is selected, the corresponding content is displayed, and the rest are hidden.

Concepts revised:

1. HTML Inputs
2. CSS Margin and Padding
3. CSS Transitions
4. CSS Hover Pseudo-class

Concepts learned:

1. CSS Selectors: >,+,~

(>) -> It is a child selector, which selects DIRECT child elements of a specified parent element.

(+) -> It is Adjacent sibling combinator. It combines two sequences of simple selectors having the same parent and the second one must come IMMEDIATELY after the first.

(~) -> It is general sibling combinator and similar to Adjacent sibling combinator. The difference is that the second selector does NOT have to immediately follow the first one means It will select all elements that is preceded by the former selector.

2. CSS :checked Pseudo-class

The checked selector is used to select all checked elements in the input tag and radio buttons. This selector is used with radio buttons, checkbox and option elements.
