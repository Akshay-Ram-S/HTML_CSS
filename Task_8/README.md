CSS Accordion Component

Objective : To build a simple accordion component using pure CSS. The accordion will allow sections of content to expand and collapse when clicked. It can be set up to allow multiple sections to be open simultaneously or restrict it to only one section being open at a time.

Concepts revised:

1. CSS :checked Pseudo-class
2. CSS Transitions
