## Pure CSS Dropdown Menu

Objective: To create a navigation bar with a dropdown submenu that is revealed on hover. Also, only HTML and CSS should be used and without the use of JavaScript.

## Concepts revised :

1. HTML lists for listing menu and submenu (unordered list).
2. CSS Positioning for basic margin, padding and colouring.
3. CSS Hover Effects while hovering the menu.
